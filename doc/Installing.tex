\chapter{Installing ANISOFLOW}

ANISOFLOW can be installed in Unix and Widows systems, but we highly recommend install it over Unix systems.

\section{Prerequisites}
To install ANISOFLOW you must have the following programs in your system working
\begin{itemize}
\item Fortran and C compiler
\item BLAS libraries
\item LACPACK libraries
\item MPICH libraries
\item PETSc 3.7 libraries
\item hdf5 libraries connected with PETSc libraries (optional and recommend)
\end{itemize}

By our experience, we know the most painful part of ANISOFLOW installation is their prerequisites, therefore, this chapter is focused of how to install those things in  Linux, Mac and Widows.
